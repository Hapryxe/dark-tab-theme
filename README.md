# dark-tab-theme
A "better" theme for new tabs on chrome
Just some Html and css with a sprinkle of JS and Json.
I locked up a tutorial from Hackernoon for the groundwork.
I "borrowed" the wallpaper from this reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/ma6n3q/minimalist_waves_3840x2160/) and edited the rest in Photoshop myself.

Do whatever u want with this just dont hurt me if u dont like it.
