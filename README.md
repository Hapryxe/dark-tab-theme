# dark-tab-theme
A "better" theme for new tabs on chrome
Just some Html and css with a sprinkle of JS and Json.
I used a documentatiom from Hackernoon for the groundwork.
I "borrowed" the wallpaper from this reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/ma6n3q/minimalist_waves_3840x2160/) and edited the rest in Photoshop myself.

The icons are from IconFinder and edited slightly.

Do whatever u want with.



## Install
Open Google chrome
Go to Settings - addons - Load Unpacked - navigate to where you saved the folder

thats it.
